Raw Signal Data Collection with Walabot
=====================================================================

Contains: WalabotDataCollect.py

This will launch the program that collects data from the Walabot. 
This is also the program where one would edit the Arena Size and Dielectric Constant of the medium(soil) for scans. 

Follow the intructions to Calibrate and Scan as the program suggests.

It creates files named:

AntennaPairs.txt which contains a list of all Antenna Pairings
TimeAxisList.txt which contains a list of the time axis data points for a scan.
SignalAmplitudeList#.txt which contains a list of the Signal Amplitudes. A new file will be made for each scan and the # field will increase for each scan.
